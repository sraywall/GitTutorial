The scripts in this folder enable you to calculate game probabilities for the Kilodeck using both Monte Carlo (kdeck.pl) and exact methods (kprobs.pl), as described in Mindhacker Hack 41, "Engineer Your Results." To run these programs on a system with a Perl interpreter, type

  perl kdeck.pl

OR

  perl kprobs.pl

within the directory where the scripts are.

The file kprobs.txt shows a sample run of the program kprobs.pl, and the file 100k.txt shows a sample run of kdeck.pl with 100,000 shuffles of the Kilodeck per hand size.

The two graphics are color versions of the card images in Hack 41; the colors of various card elements are important dimensions of the Kilodeck that could not be shown in the book.
