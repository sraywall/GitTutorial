The files in this archive accompany the Wiley book /Mindhacker: 60 Tips, Tricks, and Games to Take Your Mind to the Next Level/ by Ron Hale-Evans and Marty Hale-Evans, 2011 (ISBN 978-1-1180-0752-5, www.wiley.com/go/mindhacker).

These scripts have been tested extensively under Ubuntu 10.10, and to a lesser degree under Microsoft Windows. They should run with little or no modification on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

Most of the information you need to start running these programs, most of which are Perl scripts, is in the book's Introduction. Any special information is in the README file in the folder for each hack. 

If you get really stuck, feel free to e-mail the authors at mindhacker@ludism.org.
