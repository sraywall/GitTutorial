The bonus script in this folder is a Truncated Julian Day clock/calendar. Truncated Julian Days are described in Mindhacker Hack 19, "Tell Time Who's Boss." To run this program on a system with a Perl interpreter, type 

  perl tjd

within the directory where the tjd script is.

You will need to install the Perl Time::HiRes module (http://perldoc.perl.org/Time/HiRes.html) before you run this script.
