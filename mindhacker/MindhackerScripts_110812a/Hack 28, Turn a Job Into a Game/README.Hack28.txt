The file in this folder is a spreadsheet for playing Chore Wars: Hale-Evans Edition, from Mindhacker Hack 28, "Turn a Job into a Game." The fields in each row are as follows:

  * Week ending: The date the rewards are being calculated; "payday".

  * Total $ available: The pocket money allotment for this week.

  * Player 1 GP / Player 2 GP: The GP earned by that player this week.

  * Raw GP: The raw total of GP earned by both players.

  * Adjusted GP: The GP total adjusted by "Player 1 x" and "Player 2 x" (see below).

  * 1 GP: An exchange rate -- the value of a gold piece in dollars. A value of 0.15 means a gold piece is worth 15 cents.

  * Player 1 x / Player 2 x: A GP multiplier based on how much free time the player has and how available they are to do housework. Normally 1, but 2 if the player has an outside job.

  * Player 1 $ / Player 2 $: The player's reward for the week, in dollars.

To use this spreadsheet, fill out the following fields for a given week and the spreadsheet will do the rest:

  * Week ending
  * Total $ available
  * Player 1 GP / Player 2 GP
  * Player 1 x / Player 2 x
