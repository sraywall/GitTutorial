The script in this folder is a Mission Elapsed Time clock. Mission Elapsed Time is described in Mindhacker Hack 20, "Meet MET." To run this program on a system with a Perl interpreter, type 

  perl met.pl powells.txt

within the directory where the met.pl script is.

You will need to install the Perl Time::HiRes module (http://perldoc.perl.org/Time/HiRes.html) before you run this script.

The powells.txt file is meant only as an example. We hope you'll write and enjoy your own.
